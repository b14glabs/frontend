## Introduction
This is a frontend project that provides a user interface for interacting with a delegate platform. The application allows users to view and manage their delegate activities, including delegating to validators and tracking delegate rewards.

## Setup
Before running the project, you need to set up a MongoDB connection. This requires setting the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable. This database is used to save transaction history when generating a mock delegatedBtc event.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
2. Add the following line to the `.env.local` file:
    ```env.local
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```
3. Save the file.

## Run
```yarn dev```

- **Validator Page**: Displays delegate history, account per share charts for the last 14 days, total CORE and BTC stake, and provides options to delegate and claim rewards.
